# Feed Reader Testing Project

The Feed Reader Testing Project is a project of the Grow with Google Front-End Nanodegree Program, which contains a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The project allows improving skills in writing tests with Jasmine. These are very important part of development process and it allows to test the underlying business logic of the application and the event handling and DOM manipulation.


## How to start

The user can download or clone ZIP of repository on the local machine and open 'index.html' in a browser. Google Chrome is recommended.


## Test suites

 The following tests were written:

 *RSS Feeds
 **URL are defined

 *The menu
 **is hidden by default

 **is changed when the menu icon is clicked
